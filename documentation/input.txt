# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

StockNDock is a distributed retail platform that connects supermarkets with end customers.  
The system allows customers to register and log in, browse products, like them, comment on them and manage a shopping cart to place orders.  
Supermarkets can register on the platform, receive incoming orders and manage their catalogs by adding, updating and removing products. 
The architecture is based on Dockerized microservices, ensuring scalability, modularity and easy deployment.
